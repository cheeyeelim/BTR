\title{Calculating Boolean model score wrt to a dataset}
\usage{
calc_mscore(bmodel, istate, fcdata, overlap_gene, max_varperrule, detail = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{bmodel}{S4 BoolModel object. Model to be evaluated.}

\item{istate}{data frame. Must have only 1 row, which represents 1 initial state.}

\item{fcdata}{matrix. Represents the expression data df.}

\item{overlap_gene}{character vector. Specify which genes are present in both model and data inputs.}

\item{max_varperrule}{integer. Maximum number of terms per rule (combining both act and inh rule). Note that this number must not be smaller than number of variables. Default to 6.}

\item{detail}{logical. Whether to give more details in score calculation. Default to FALSE.}
}
